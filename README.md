# GTA5_Mods
Repo for storing gta 5 mods, in preparation for thesis work

in directory validation_images, I stored real images used for validation. All images can be used for non commercial works. 

You can find link attributions for every image in files images.txt and pages.txt

In images.txt for each line you find [image_name]: [img link].
In pages.txt for each line you find [image_name]: [page link].
